atto_mathslate
=================

Mathslate is a graphical tool for constructing mathematics within Moodle.
This plugin adds the tool to the Atto editor. One version supports the
Atto prototype of Moodle 2.5 and 2.6 and another version is for Moodle
2.7+.  Install this directory as a subdirectory in the Moodle directory
lib/editor/atto/plugins with the named mathslate.  Also install the
corresponding plugin for tinymce in lib/editor/tinymcie/plugins/mathslate.
Then visit the administrators notification page to install the plugin
to the database and adjust the settings.  The settings common to both
will appear in the TinyMCE settings submenu.

This requires MathJax to run. It will work if the MathJaxloader 'filter'
is enabled.  It is also compatible with MathJax in the header.  For more
information of MathJax see mathjax.org.
