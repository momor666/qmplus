<p>The second Histogram graph also compares your performance in the activity to other students who have been awarded grades.
However, it divides the data across a range of values as determined by the mark scheme for the activity.
The blue bar shows which group you fall into which should give you a good indication if you are in a high, middle, or low performing group.
It should also give you an indication of how well your peers have scored overall in the activity.</p>
