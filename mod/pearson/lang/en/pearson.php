This integration provides the ability for the instructor and students to log in to Moodle and click a link from a Moodle course to access their MyLab / Mastering or Course Connect experience without the need for the user to create a new account, a course, or to log in a second time. Instructors can work with their Pearson representative to design the course experience they wish their students to have.

This integration provides:

* Single sign-on (SSO) from the Moodle course directly into the MyLab / Mastering or CourseConnect course. This standards-based integration uses IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), a proven integration protocol.
* Custom course development by Pearson media editors with input from the instructor and instructional design best practices.
* Direct links to MyLab / Mastering or CourseConnect courses ensure the student is presented with the educational materials they need within the context of the Moodle course frame.';
