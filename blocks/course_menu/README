Version Updates:

2017080300 - When clicked in a section, all the opening sections were closed and clicked section was opened. Furthermore, the scroll position was also properly adjusted. The changes were made in navigation.js where a new method was added to the TREE object,

And error handlers were added so that there are no console errors when the course format is not collapsible.
